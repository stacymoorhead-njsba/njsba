# Legislative Corner

This is a collection of governmental relations posts and actions.

Much of the post content here is likely to be removed in the migration.

This will become more of an advocacy/action center for legislative issues, directing visitors (mostly school board members) to take action.

The advocacy platform in use is [Phone2Action](http://phone2action.com/)
