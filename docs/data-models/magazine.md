# School Leader

Structurally, the School Leader magazine is similar to the [School Board Notes][newsletter.md] newsletter, except that:

* content is published bimonthly instead of weekly
* a PDF/print document accompanies the magazine.

The print magazine is created first and the content is adapted for the web by communications staff.

## Issue

_taxonomy_

Each issue of School Leader is a collection of articles, with a link to the [ZMags](http://zmags.com) "flippable" PDF.

## Article

_post type_

Articles are plain web content, possibly with embeds of video or other assets.

The appearance of each article should be consistent with the others. Currently, this is accomplished by Production staff editing Word content into copy/pasted "templates" using PHP includes for the wrapper.
