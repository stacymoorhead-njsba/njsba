# Front Page

Different sections of the site front page are modeled or aggregated from different types of content.

## What's New

Entries in this section are updated manually at present.

Content linked to includes:

* press releases
* newsletter content
* blog posts

These are all likely to be at least one post type under the redesign.

## Right Column

### Act Now

The links here are currently populated manually into a SQL backend.
Most are links out to NJSBA's Personify portal.

### Get Involved

This content is mostly evergreen, and a mix of links to internal pages and external resources.

### In The News

The links here are currently populated manually into a SQL backend.

This section is particularly difficult to curate and may be dropped from the site altogether.

Best option is likely to have this be a feed of recent posts to the [news](news.md) section.

### Upcoming Meetings

This is populated by a Personify event feed pulled in via API.

### Critical Issues

This content section may be removed.

### Popular Resources

this is an evergreen collection of internal links. The section itself is likely to be removed but some similar collection like this should remain.
